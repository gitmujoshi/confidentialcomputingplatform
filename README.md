# Confidential Computing Platform

A comprehensive platform for secure multi-party data collaboration using Confidential Computing capabilities across major cloud providers.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Confidential Computing platform that enables secure multi-party data collaboration with a focus on privacy-preserving AI/ML workflows. The platform is designed to be cloud-agnostic with specific implementations for AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI.

## Key Features

- Secure multi-party data collaboration
- Privacy-preserving AI/ML workflows
- Cloud-agnostic architecture
- Zero-trust security model
- Comprehensive security controls
- Multi-cloud support
- Hardware-level security with secure enclaves
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure key management
- Cross-cloud data sharing capabilities
