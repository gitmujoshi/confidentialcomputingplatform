# Confidential Computing Platform

A comprehensive platform for secure multi-party data collaboration using Confidential Computing capabilities across major cloud providers.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Confidential Computing platform that enables secure multi-party data collaboration with a focus on privacy-preserving AI/ML workflows. The platform is designed to be cloud-agnostic with specific implementations for AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI.

## Key Features

- Secure multi-party data collaboration
- Privacy-preserving AI/ML workflows
- Cloud-agnostic architecture
- Zero-trust security model
- Comprehensive security controls
- Multi-cloud support

## Documentation

- [Logical Architecture](docs/LogicalArchitecture.md)
- [OCI Implementation Design](docs/OCI_Implementation_Design.md)
- [OCI Training Workflow](docs/OCI_Training_Workflow.md)
- [AI/ML Workload Specification](docs/AI_ML_Workload_Spec.md)
