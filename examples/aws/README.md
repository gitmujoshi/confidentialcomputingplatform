# AWS Secure Training Setup

This directory contains scripts and configurations for running secure machine learning training jobs on AWS using SageMaker with encryption and security features.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS CLI installed and configured
2. Python 3.8 or later
3. Required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install boto3 sagemaker torch torchvision
   ```

## Configuration

1. Update `config.json` with your AWS settings:
   - Replace `123456789012` with your AWS account ID
   - Update KMS key IDs and ARNs
   - Configure VPC, subnet, and security group IDs
   - Set appropriate instance types and sizes

2. Ensure IAM roles and permissions:
   - SageMaker execution role with necessary permissions
   - KMS key access permissions
   - S3 bucket access permissions

## Directory Structure

```
aws/
├── config.json           # AWS configuration
├── train.py             # Training script
├── training_job.py      # Training job management
└── utils.py            # Utility functions
```

## Usage

1. Set up secure environment:
   ```bash
   python utils.py
   ```

2. Start training job:
   ```bash
   python training_job.py
   ```

3. Monitor training progress:
   ```bash
   # The training job script includes monitoring
   # Or use AWS Console to monitor jobs
   ```

## Security Features

- Data encryption at rest using AWS KMS
- Network isolation using VPC
- Secure inter-container traffic
- IAM role-based access control
- Secure storage with S3 encryption

## Monitoring and Logging

- Training metrics available through SageMaker
- CloudWatch logs for detailed monitoring
- S3 access logs for storage monitoring

## Cleanup

To clean up resources:
1. Stop any running training jobs
2. Delete model artifacts from S3
3. Clean up temporary files

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. IAM permission errors: Check role permissions
2. VPC configuration issues: Verify subnet and security group settings
3. Storage access errors: Verify S3 bucket permissions
4. KMS key errors: Check key policy and access
