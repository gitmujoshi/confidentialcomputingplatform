# GCP Confidential Computing Training Workflow

## Overview

This document describes the secure training workflow implementation using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Confidential Computing services.

## Workflow Components

### 1. Client Environment
- Client application
- Configuration management
- Secure communication
- Status monitoring

### 2. GCP Services
- Confidential VMs
- Cloud KMS
- Cloud HSM
- Cloud Storage

### 3. Secure Environment
- AMD SEV-based VM
- Encrypted data
- ML model
- Security monitoring

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initialization
1. Client requests training job
2. Configuration is loaded
3. Environment is prepared
4. Security checks are performed

### 2. Environment Setup
1. Confidential VM is launched
2. AMD SEV is configured
3. Keys are retrieved from KMS
4. Cloud Storage is configured

### 3. Data Preparation
1. Training data is loaded from Cloud Storage
2. Data is encrypted
3. Data is transferred to VM
4. Data validation is performed

### 4. Model Training
1. Model is initialized
2. Training loop begins
3. Checkpoints are saved
4. Progress is monitored

### 5. Completion
1. Model is saved to Cloud Storage
2. Results are encrypted
3. Resources are cleaned up
4. Client is notified

## Security Measures

### 1. Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure key management
- Data access controls
- Encryption at rest

### 2. Environment Security
- Hardware-level protection
- AMD SEV
- Memory encryption
- Secure boot

### 3. Access Control
- IAM integration
- Service accounts
- VPC Service Controls
- Network policies

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Performance Monitoring
- Cloud Monitoring metrics
- Training progress
- System metrics
- Network performance

### 2. Security Monitoring
- Access attempts
- Security events
- Compliance status
- Threat detection

### 3. Logging
- Cloud Logging
- Security logs
- System logs
- Audit trails

## Error Handling

### 1. Common Errors
- Resource limitations
- Network issues
- Security violations
- Data problems

### 2. Recovery Procedures
- Automatic retries
- Fallback options
- Error reporting
- Cleanup procedures

## Best Practices

### 1. Security
- Regular key rotation
