# Azure Confidential Computing Training Workflow

## Overview

This document describes the secure training workflow implementation using Azure Confidential Computing services.

## Workflow Components

### 1. Client Environment
- Client application
- Configuration management
- Secure communication
- Status monitoring

### 2. Azure Services
- Confidential VM (DCsv2-series)
- Azure Attestation Service
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage

### 3. Secure Environment
- Intel SGX enclave
- Encrypted data
- ML model
- Security monitoring

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initialization
1. Client requests training job
2. Configuration is loaded
3. Environment is prepared
4. Security checks are performed

### 2. Environment Setup
1. VM is provisioned
2. Attestation is performed
3. Keys are retrieved
4. Storage is configured

### 3. Data Preparation
1. Training data is loaded
2. Data is encrypted
3. Data is transferred to enclave
4. Data validation is performed

### 4. Model Training
1. Model is initialized
2. Training loop begins
3. Checkpoints are saved
4. Progress is monitored

### 5. Completion
1. Model is saved
2. Results are encrypted
3. Resources are cleaned up
4. Client is notified

## Security Measures

### 1. Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure key management
- Data access controls
- Encryption at rest

### 2. Environment Security
- Hardware-level protection
- Secure enclaves
- Memory encryption
- Secure boot

### 3. Access Control
