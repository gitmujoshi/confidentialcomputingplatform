# Secure Training Workflow

## Overview

The secure training workflow ensures that machine learning model training is performed in a confidential computing environment with proper security controls and monitoring.

## Training Workflow Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the secure training workflow:

Note over Monitor: Continuous security monitoring
```

The workflow consists of the following steps:

## Workflow Steps

1. **Initialization**
   - Client initiates training job
   - Configuration is loaded
   - Environment is prepared

2. **Environment Verification**
   - Attestation request is made
   - Environment integrity is verified
   - Security posture is validated

3. **Resource Access**
   - Encryption keys are retrieved
   - Training data is loaded
   - Secure environment is established

4. **Training Process**
   - Data is decrypted in secure enclave
   - Model training is performed
   - Checkpoints are saved securely

5. **Monitoring and Security**
   - Progress is monitored
   - Security events are tracked
   - Alerts are generated if needed

6. **Completion**
   - Final model is saved
   - Resources are cleaned up
   - Results are returned to client

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
